# MyCourse-Api-and-Client
App where users can store metadata about online courses and programs they are excited about.

The Api is built with Nodejs and Express, it uses MongoDB as a document database, and the client is built with React.

NOTE: this version does not show the api's base url for sending queries in the client fetch requests. You must visit your replit profile for that. Also you must visit replit to see all api files and code.
